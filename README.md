# Stock-Market-Prediction-Project
This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning and 
deep learning techniques to predict stock prices. Specifically, it utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to train a robust 
model using historical data from Google stocks. By harnessing the 
capabilities of LSTM, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), this project endeavors to accurately forecast future stock 
prices based on patterns and trends discovered in the historical data
used to make predictions about future stock prices. 
These predictions are typically presented in the form of a graph that 
compares the predicted price of the stock to the actual price of the 
stock over a given period of time.
The resulting graph provides investors with a deep analysis of the 
trend of the stock market price based on the training data. This 
information can be used to make informed decisions about when to 
buy or sell stocks, based on the predicted future price of the stock
